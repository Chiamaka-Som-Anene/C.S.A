    <hr>
    <h3>Grilled meat and palm wine</h3>
    <h4>i like soft meat that is easy to chew, and wine because it pairs well with grills, also really nice on the tounge.</h4> 
    <h3>roasted corn and plantain</h3>
    <h4>i like the burnt taste of roasted foods</h4>
    <h3>Oha Soup and Fufu</h3>
    <h4>i like swallow that is smooth on my throat, and i can not explain the jazz that Oha has done to me.</h4>
